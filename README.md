# HYCOM-src

This is the HYCOM-src repository for the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) source code.

HYCOM uses conventional Primitive Equation 2nd order finite volume dynamics in the horizontal and solves the layered continuity equation.  However, in the vertical it uses the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) approach to extend its range of applicability beyond that of a standard layered Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM).

# Where to find the information

All information about the HYCOM-src (installation, compilation) are described in the [HYCOM-src Wiki](https://github.com/HYCOM/HYCOM-src/wiki) page.
